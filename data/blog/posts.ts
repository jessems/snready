## The CSA Holder's Trap

You passed CSA. You've been working in ServiceNow for a year. You've resolved hundreds of incidents, processed change requests, linked problems to their causes.

CIS-ITSM should be easy, right?

Wrong. The failure rate for experienced ServiceNow admins on CIS-ITSM is higher than you'd expect.

Here's why.

## CSA Breadth vs. CIS-ITSM Depth

CSA covers ITSM topics:
- Incident states and priority
- Problem linking
- Change types
- Basic workflows

CIS-ITSM goes deeper:
- Major incident management with communication plans
- Problem management lifecycle with root cause analysis
- Change risk calculation with CAB workflows
- SLA retroactive start behavior
- Request fulfillment automation patterns

If CSA is "know what these modules do," CIS-ITSM is "know how to IMPLEMENT these modules correctly."

## The Implementation Mindset

CIS stands for Certified Implementation Specialist. Not Certified User. Not Certified Administrator.

Implementation means:
- Configuring from scratch, not just modifying existing setup
- Understanding why features are designed the way they are
- Knowing best practices for deployment
- Troubleshooting configuration issues

Example question:

> "A customer wants incidents automatically assigned based on the Configuration Item. What would you configure?"

CSA answer: "Assignment rules."

CIS-ITSM answer: "Assignment rules with CI-based conditions, but first verify CI data quality, consider assignment groups vs. individual assignment, evaluate escalation paths for unassigned CIs, and document the rule order since multiple rules might match."

The implementation specialist thinks through the full solution.

## Topics That Trip People Up

### 1. Major Incident Management

CSA barely touches this. CIS-ITSM expects you to know:

- When to declare a major incident (criteria-based, not just "it's bad")
- Communication plans (who gets notified, when, through what channel)
- Major incident workspaces and dashboards
- Post-major incident reviews
- The difference between "major" and "high priority"

The last one is critical: **Major incident is a process designation. Priority is a data value.** A P1 incident isn't automatically a major incident. A major incident might not even be P1.

### 2. Change Advisory Board (CAB) Workflows

CSA knows "changes need approval."

CIS-ITSM knows:
- How to configure CAB date definitions
- Emergency change authorization paths that bypass CAB
- Automatic approval rules based on risk
- How change conflicts are detected and displayed
- Change model vs. standard change templates

You need to understand not just that CAB exists, but how to implement a CAB process for a customer.

### 3. SLA Edge Cases

CSA: "SLAs measure response and resolution time."

CIS-ITSM:
- What happens when SLA retroactively starts?
- How do business hours affect breach calculations?
- When does stage advancement reset the SLA clock?
- How are multiple SLAs on the same record prioritized?
- What's the difference between task SLAs and table SLAs?

The exam loves edge cases because implementation specialists encounter them.

### 4. Request Fulfillment Patterns

Request management seems simple: someone orders something, someone fulfills it.

But implementation requires understanding:
- Multi-item orders with separate fulfillment tasks
- Approval routing based on item cost
- Requested Item vs. Catalog Task workflows
- Fulfillment groups and assignment logic
- Order guides for complex bundled requests

You're not just using the Service Catalog — you're designing it.

### 5. Problem Management as a Real Process

CSA knows: Problem linked to Incident, Known Error article, Root Cause field.

CIS-ITSM knows:
- Problem detection methods (trend analysis, major incident review)
- Problem investigation workflows
- Workaround vs. permanent solution
- Known Error Database (KEDB) management
- Problem task assignment for investigation
- When to close a problem vs. keep it open

## The Study Approach That Works

### 1. Think Implementation, Not Usage

When studying a feature, ask:
- How would I configure this from scratch?
- What decisions would I make for a new customer?
- What are the best practices vs. "it works" approaches?

### 2. Cover the Overlooked Topics

Everyone knows Incident Management. Fewer study:
- ITSM guided setup
- Agent Intelligence for classification
- Virtual Agent integration
- Walk-up Experience
- SLA definitions at a technical level

### 3. Use Real Implementation Documentation

ServiceNow's product documentation includes implementation guides. These are more useful than the exam guide for understanding implementation context.

### 4. Practice Scenario Questions

CIS-ITSM loves scenarios:

> "A customer's incident response SLA keeps breaching even though agents respond within 5 minutes. The SLA is set to 15 minutes. What would you check first?"

This requires diagnostic thinking, not just knowledge.

## The Exam Itself

- 60 questions, 90 minutes
- 70% to pass (42/60)
- Multi-select exists (choose 2, choose all that apply)
- Scenario-based questions are common
- Questions assume CSA knowledge (they won't explain what an ACL is)

**Prerequisite:** CSA is required. You can't register for CIS-ITSM without it.

## Preparation Timeline

Assuming you have CSA and work with ITSM:

- **Week 1-2:** Deep dive on major incident and problem management
- **Week 3:** Change management implementation details
- **Week 4:** SLA edge cases and request fulfillment
- **Week 5:** Practice exams and gap identification

If you don't work with ITSM daily, add 2-3 weeks of hands-on practice in a PDI.

## The Bottom Line

CIS-ITSM isn't "CSA part 2." It's an implementation certification that expects consultant-level understanding of ITSM configuration.

If you use ITSM daily but don't configure it, you need to shift your mindset. Think like someone building the system, not using it.
